# Sparta-JSON-Parsing
Create a new Github repo called Sparta-JSON-Parsing and go through the steps from class to parse through a JSON document of your creation into a Ruby class and write at least 5 tests. I would recommend using the Mockaroo JSON generator. The JSON file should have at least 1 nested object and one nested array

## Test Numbers and Aims:
The Data...
1.  must contain 50 rows of data
2.  must, in each of these rows, contain a Hash of 4 items
3.  must, in each of these rows, contain a first and second name, both of which are strings
4.  must, in each of these rows, contain an array of 3 emails, all of which are valid emails
5.  must, in each of these rows, contain a nested hash address, which contains a country and city, both of which are strings
